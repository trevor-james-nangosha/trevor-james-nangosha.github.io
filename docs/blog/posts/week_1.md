# Week 1 (27th May - 3rd June)

This week is mostly orientation and setting up in preparation for the journey ahead.

<!-- more -->

- I will be writing some React code next week, so I will use this time to brush up on those core React concepts. It's been a while!.
- Another interesting thing is setting up my blog on Github pages. It wasn't so hard since I had setup something similar in the past, and so it just needed a little twerking to get it up and running. I used [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) by the way.
