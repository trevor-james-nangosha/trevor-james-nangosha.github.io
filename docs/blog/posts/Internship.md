# Internship

I am pleased to share that I will be starting my internship at **Bodastage Solutions**, and it will be running for atleast 8 weeks. I will be documenting my progress over that time and providing a status update at the end of every week, most importantly the different challenges I face and how to fix them. I hope that at the end of it all, this internship will turn out to be a wonderful experience.

**Primary mentors**: Emmanuel Robert Ssebagala, Patricia Atungire Ssebagala
